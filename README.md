PythonVoiceCodingPlugin is a Sublime Text 3 plugin meant to enhance user experience 
when coding python 3 by voice.

## Motivation

The project was inspired by article on this state of voice coding  and my personal experiences
with  Caster. Despite the excellent work put behind this awesome dragonfly based toolkit, 
there were some times where I felt that 

In particular, navigation through the code sometimes felt a little bit too mechanistic. 
that it would feel much more natural,cooler  and potentially faster if the system could understand my code syntically.
In that way we could use higher level commands such as "select argument three" or "select outer if condition"
